	<H1>Basics about Inline and BlockLine elements</H1>
	<H2>All headin tags are block elelments
	from H1 to H6 as seen here in the code base</H2>
	<H3>Other elements such as strong or em are inline elements. Their usage can be seen down below under p tag</H3>
	<p>This is a paragraph tag. We would like to use the strong tag which is used for <strong>emphasizing</strong> the elements. The strong tag works like the bold tag known as b. You can see here <b>India</b> is in bold by using a bTag </p>
	<p>Here inside a second paragraph we can use em tag to italicize text. So em tag can be used to <em> italicize </em> text. You can also use i tag to <i>italicize</i> text too</p>
